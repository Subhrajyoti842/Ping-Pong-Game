table tennis, also called (trademark) Ping-Pong, ball game similar in principle to lawn tennis and played on a flat table divided into two equal courts by a net fixed across its width at the middle. The object is to hit the ball so that it goes over the net and bounces on the opponent’s half of the table in such a way that the opponent cannot reach it or return it correctly. The lightweight hollow ball is propelled back and forth across the net by small rackets (bats, or paddles) held by the players. The game is popular all over the world. In most countries it is very highly organized as a competitive sport, especially in Europe and Asia, particularly in China and Japan.

History
The game was invented in England in the early days of the 20th century and was originally called Ping-Pong, a trade name. The name table tennis was adopted in 1921–22 when the old Ping-Pong Association formed in 1902 was revived. The original association had broken up about 1905, though apparently the game continued to be played in parts of England outside London and by the 1920s was being played in many countries. Led by representatives of Germany, Hungary, and England, the Fédération Internationale de Tennis de Table (International Table Tennis Federation) was founded in 1926, the founding members being England, Sweden, Hungary, India, Denmark, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Wales. By the mid-1990s more than 165 national associations were members.

The first world championships were held in London in 1926, and from then until 1939 the game was dominated by players from central Europe, the men’s team event being won nine times by Hungary and twice by Czechoslovakia. In the mid-1950s Asia emerged as a breeding ground of champions, and from that time the individual and team events (for both men and women) have been dominated by athletes from China. The popularity of the game in China was notable for giving rise to so-called “Ping-Pong diplomacy,” a period during the 1970s in which Cold War tensions between China and the United States were eased via a series of highly publicized table tennis matches between athletes from the two countries. The first such event—held in Beijing in 1971—is widely credited with paving the way for U.S. Pres. Richard Nixon’s historic visit to China the following year. In 1980 the first World Cup was held, and Guo Yuehua of China won the $12,500 first prize. Table tennis became an Olympic sport in 1988, with singles and doubles competition for men and women.

Equipment, rules, and play of the game
Table tennis equipment is relatively simple and inexpensive. The table is rectangular, 9 by 5 feet (2.7 by 1.5 metres), its upper surface a level plane 30 inches (76 cm) above the floor. The net is 6 feet (1.8 metres) long, and its upper edge along the whole length is 6 inches (15.25 cm) above the playing surface. The ball, which is spherical and hollow, was once made of white celluloid. Since 1969 a plastic similar to celluloid has been used. The ball, which may be coloured white, yellow, or orange, weighs about 0.09 ounce (2.7 grams) and has a diameter of about 1.6 inches (4 cm). The blade of a racket, or bat, is usually made of wood, is flat and rigid, and may be covered with a thin layer of ordinary stippled, or pimpled, rubber, which may be laid over a thin layer of sponge rubber and may have the pimples reversed. Whatever combination is used, each of the two sides of a paddle must be different in colour. The racket may be any size, weight, or shape.

A match consists of the best of any odd numbers of games, each game being won by the player who first reaches 11 points or who, after 10 points each, wins two clear points ahead. A point is scored when the server fails to make a good service, when either player fails to make a good return, or when either player commits a specified infraction (e.g., touches the playing surface with a free hand while the ball is in play). Service changes hands after every two points until 10-all is reached, when it changes after every subsequent point.

The serve is made from behind the end of the table, the server tossing the ball upward from the palm of the free hand and striking it as it descends so that it first bounces on the server’s own court and then, passing over the net, bounces on the opponent’s court. In serving, no spin may be imparted to the ball by the fingers. This was not always so. Finger spin, especially in the United States, reached a stage where the experts could produce untakable services and the game became farcical. Finger spin was universally banned in 1937.


Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s.

Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play

pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play

pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play

pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play

pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play

pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play

pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play

pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play

pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

Interest to the spectator lies in observing the ability of one player to defeat another by well-thought-out strategy. Increasing the speed of the game, slowing it down, varying the direction of or imparting different spin or pace to the ball, and employing gentle drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are some of the tactics that may be used to support the strategy planned.

Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. The service changes after each point.

Table tennis may be played with one player at each end of the table or with two players at each end who may be both men or both women or one of each. Worldwide, the women’s game is comparable in organization to the men’s, and women take part in world championships and all other organized events. Table tennis as well as being fully organized is also extremely popular as a recreational game and is so played in all types of sports clubs, social clubs, and game rooms, in the home, and even outdoors when conditions are reasonably calm.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Britannica Quiz Sports Fun Facts Quiz
Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the next year.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation), the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.

Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1972 and as an exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.


Competitive badminton is usually played indoors because even light winds affect the course of the shuttlecock. (Recreational badminton, on the other hand, is a popular outdoor summertime activity.) The rectangular court is 44 feet (13.4 metres) long and 17 feet (5.2 metres) wide for singles, 20 feet (6.1 metres) wide for doubles. A net 5 feet (1.5 metres) high stretches across the width of the court at its centre. A clear space of 4 feet (1.3 metres) around the court is needed. Play consists entirely of volleying—hitting the shuttlecock back and forth across the net without letting it touch the floor or ground within the boundaries of the court.

In international play, athletes compete in best-of-three-games matches. A game is played to 21 points, provided that the winner has at least a 2-point advantage. If a 2-point advantage is never reached, the first player or team to score 30 points wins. Points were only awarded to the serving side until 2006, when the BWF adopted the “rally scoring” system, under which either side can score at any time.

chariot racing, in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homer’s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.

From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.

Britannica Quiz Sports Quiz
Under the Roman Empire, the chariot teams were organized into four principal factions, each managed by a different association of contractors and each distinguished by a different colour: red, white, blue, and green. Enthusiasm for the favourite colour often led to disorder; Juvenal, the Roman satirist of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, said that, if the greens lost, the whole city would be downcast, as if some great national defeat had occurred. In the later Empire these factions played a part in political and (after Christianization) religious controversies. Under Justinian, the blues were identified with Orthodoxy and the greens with Monophysitism, a heretical doctrine.

pickleball, fast-paced sport that has many similarities to tennis, badminton, and table tennis (Ping-Pong). It is played on a level court with short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball that is volleyed over a low net. Matches feature two opposing players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles), and the sport can be played either outdoors or indoors. Pickleball was invented in the United States in 1965, and in the early 21st century it experienced rapid growth. It is now played worldwide by people of all ages and skill levels.

Equipment and rules of play
pickleball
pickleball
Pickleball equipment is relatively simple. An official court measures 20 by 44 feet (6.1 by 13.4 metres) for both singles and doubles matches; these are the same dimensions as a doubles court in badminton. The pickleball net is 34 inches (86 cm) high at its centre and 36 inches (91 cm) high at the sides of the court. Players use solid, smooth-surfaced paddles, typically made of wood or composite materials. Paddles may be no longer than 17 inches (43 cm). The combined length and width of a paddle may not exceed 24 inches (61 cm). There are no restrictions, however, on the thickness or weight of a paddle. The balls are lightweight and measure from 2.87 to 2.97 inches (7.3 to 7.5 cm) in diameter.

Play starts with a cross-court serve from behind the baseline (the boundary line at each end of the court). Players must serve with an underhand stroke. The aim is to make the ball clear the net and land in the service area diagonally opposite the server, avoiding a designated non-volley zone (known as “the kitchen”) that extends 7 feet (2.1 metres) on either side of the net. The receiving player must let the ball bounce once before returning the serve. After one initial bounce on each side of the court, players can choose whether to volley the ball directly in the air or let it bounce before hitting it.

Only the serving player or team is able to score a point. After serving, a point is scored when an opposing player commits a fault, or error. Faults include failing to return the ball, hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds, and letting the ball bounce more than once. Volleying a ball from a position within the non-volley zone is also prohibited. This prevents players from charging the net and smashing the ball against an opponent. The server is allowed one attempt to get the ball into play. He or she continues to serve until losing a rally, and then the serve switches to the opposing player. In doubles play, both players on a particular side are given the opportunity to serve the ball before the serve switches to the opposing side. Games are typically played to 11 points. Tournament games may be played to 15 or 21 points. Games must be won by at least 2 points.

History, organization, and expansion
Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 by a group of neighbours on Bainbridge Island, Washington. The group included Washington state representative Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum. Looking for a game to play with their families but lacking a full set of badminton equipment, the neighbours created a new sport using an old badminton court, Ping-Pong paddles, and a Wiffle ball (a perforated ball used in a version of baseball). They lowered the badminton net to roughly the height of a tennis net and also modified the other equipment.

Soon the group formulated the basic rules for pickleball. According to one account, the name pickleball was suggested by Pritchard’s wife, Joan Pritchard. The mixing of elements and equipment from several different sports reminded her of a “pickle boat,” which is a boat made up of rowers from different crews who race together for fun at the end of a rowing competition. Another account claims that the sport took its name from the Pritchards’ dog Pickles, though the family has stated that the dog was named after the sport.

In 1972 the founders of pickleball established a corporation to advance the sport. The first pickleball tournament was held in Tukwila, Washington, four years later. The United States Amateur Pickleball Association (later known as USA Pickleball) was organized as a national governing body for the sport in 1984. That year the organization published the first official rulebook for pickleball. By the 1990s the sport was being played in every U.S. state. In the early 21st century it has seen incredible growth, and its wide appeal across age groups led community centres, YMCAs, and retirement communities to add pickleball courts to their facilities. The sport was also included in many physical education classes in schools. By 2022 pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with nearly five million participants. That year also saw a number of athletes, including Tom Brady and LeBron James, investing in Major League Pickleball.


Pickleball also became popular in other countries. In 2010 the International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was organized to help develop the sport and promote it around the world. The original member associations were located in the United States, Canada, India, and Spain. Over the next decade the number of countries with IFP member associations and groups increased to more than 60. The IFP has specified one of its main goals to be gaining the inclusion of pickleball as a sport in the Olympic Games.

Several major pickleball tournaments are held annually. Top competitions in the United States include the USA Pickleball National Championships and the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Both tournaments feature men’s and women’s singles and doubles matches as well as mixed doubles. The championships are open to amateur and professional players alike. The IFP’s premier event is the Bainbridge Cup tournament, named for the birthplace of the sport. The Bainbridge Cup’s format features pickleball teams representing different continents competing against one another.

leisure, freedom provided by the cessation of coerced activities, particularly time free from disagreeable work or duties.

Leisure is universal. Under ordinary circumstances everyone experiences some of it, even if they may know it by another name. In some parts of the world it has no name, being only agreeable residual activity in which people engage when not seeking their livelihood (working). Taking leisure is also an ancient practice. Both Aristotle and Plato discussed the virtues of what can be described as serious leisure. Indeed, it is clear that leisure is as old as humanity.

More From Britannica United Kingdom: Leisure
Despite its universality, many people the world over have some trouble recognizing leisure even when they are engaging in it. The problem is, in part, linguistic, as it is difficult to find reasonably precise terms for that which is leisure and nonleisure. But a related part of the problem is defining leisure itself.

Work, nonwork obligation, and leisure
One can examine life’s ordinary activities according to three domains: work, nonwork obligation, and leisure. Work is defined as activity that one must do: an obligation that, when met, results in one’s livelihood. Most people dislike work as an activity. If they could find an appealing way of gaining that livelihood, they would be inclined to adopt it. Nonwork obligation is the domain of all those disliked activities one must do that are done outside the domain of work. Many ordinary, sometimes daily, household chores fall into that category (e.g., washing dishes, cleaning house, and shoveling snow). To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.

To be classified as such, however, they must be felt to be disagreeable. People who like cleaning house would not count it as a nonwork obligation.

Among the reasons that leisure can be difficult to recognize is that under certain conditions it overlaps the other two domains. What about those people who like their work? Or people who enjoy certain common nonwork obligations such as grocery shopping and walking their dog? Moreover, even activities commonly thought of as leisure can have obligatory aspects, such as promising to take a friend out for dinner. (Many of such obligations, however, are pleasant.) The apparent inconsistency in such examples is resolved when they are redefined as leisure rather than as work or nonwork obligation. That definition holds that leisure is uncoerced, contextually framed activity engaged in during free time, which people want to do and, using their abilities and resources, actually do in a satisfying or a fulfilling way (or both).

“Free time” in that definition refers to time away from unpleasant, or disagreeable, obligation, with pleasant obligation being treated as essentially leisure. In other words, a person at leisure feels no significant coercion to enact the activity in question. Some kinds of work described as “devotee work” may be conceived of as pleasant obligation, in that people who do such work, though they must make a living, do so as a highly intrinsically appealing pursuit. Work of that sort is also essentially leisure, in that getting paid to do it only makes possible pursuit of a deeply fulfilling interest.

Uncoerced, people at leisure believe that they are doing something they are not disagreeably obliged to do. In that definition emphasis is on the acting individual and the play of human agency. That in no way denies, however, that some people want to do things they cannot do. They find their choices frustrated by certain limiting social and personal conditions such as aptitude, ability, socialized leisure tastes, knowledge of available activities, and accessibility of activities. In other words, when using that definition of leisure—whose central ingredient is lack of coercion—one must be sure to understand leisure activities in relation to their larger personal, structural, cultural, and historical context. Consequently, leisure is not actually freely chosen, for choice of activity is significantly shaped by that background.

Free time, as conventionally defined, cannot be regarded in this discussion as synonymous with leisure. One can be bored in his or her free time, which can result from inactivity (having “nothing to do”) or from activity that is uninteresting or unstimulating. The same can, of course, happen at work and in obligated nonwork settings. Because boredom is a decidedly negative state of mind, it may be argued that, logically, it is not leisure at all. Leisure is typically conceived of as a positive state of mind, composed of, among other sentiments, pleasant expectations and recollections of activities and situations. Of course, it sometimes happens that expectations turn out to be unrealistic; individuals then get bored (or perhaps angry, frightened, or embarrassed) with the activity in question, transforming it in their view into something quite other than leisure.

Types of leisure activity
For the foregoing condensed definition of leisure to be understood, its reference to “uncoerced activity” must be clarified by defining “activity.” An activity is a type of pursuit wherein its participants mentally or physically (often both) do something motivated by the hope of achieving a desired end. Life is filled with activities, both pleasant and unpleasant: sleeping, mowing the lawn, taking the train to work, having a tooth filled, eating lunch, playing tennis, running a meeting, and on and on. Activities, as that list illustrates, may be categorized as work, leisure, or nonwork obligation. They are, furthermore, general. In some instances they refer to the behavioral side of recognizable roles—for example, as a commuter, tennis player, or chair of a meeting. In others one may recognize the activity but not conceive of it formally as the embodiment of a role, such as someone sleeping, mowing a lawn, or eating lunch (not as a patron in a restaurant).


Most common of the various leisure activities are the “casual,” essentially hedonic pursuits that are undertaken mainly for the pure fun of doing so and that require minimal skill and knowledge. In many parts of the world, watching television is the number one casual leisure activity, while socializing, strolling, lounging, having sex, eating, and gambling are also popular. Most people generally think of leisure as the pursuit of casual activity.

Yet the leisure domain is further composed of two other types. One is “serious leisure,” the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer activity sufficiently substantial, interesting, and fulfilling for the participant to find a (leisure) career in its practice. In the process of pursuing serious leisure, the individual acquires and expresses a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience. The other type of leisure is “project-based leisure,” a short-term, reasonably complicated, one-shot or occasional though infrequent creative undertaking carried out in free time or time free of disagreeable obligation. Examples include making a macramé decoration from a kit, writing a family genealogy, organizing a 50th-wedding-anniversary celebration, and volunteering for a major arts festival. Both types sometimes lead to substantial community contributions, as in such serious leisure as community orchestra concerts, quilting exhibitions, and volunteer firefighting.


Serious leisure, in many ways, offers the greatest opportunity for finding self-fulfillment, though such is also possible on a much-more-limited scale with project-based leisure. Amateurs, hobbyists, and serious volunteers often find rest and relaxation in various casual interests, which they seek between sessions of serious activity.

net, an open fabric of thread, cord, or wire, the intersections of which are looped or knotted so as to form a mesh. Nets are primarily used for fishing.

The early stages in the manufacture and use of nets are difficult to trace because materials were perishable and tools simple, but there is strong evidence that nets were employed by the hunter-gatherers of southern Europe from Upper Paleolithic times. Primitive netting was fabricated with thread or cord made from a wide range of vegetable fibres (bark, bast, leaves, roots, and stems) and animal tissues (hide, sinew, hair, intestine, and baleen). Modern nets, generally machine-made, are composed either of vegetable fibres (such as cotton, hemp, flax, manila, and sisal) or of man-made fibres (such as nylon, polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene). The man-made fibres are inherently rotproof, whereas vegetable fibres must be treated against rot with substances such as tar.

The primary types of net used for fishing are drift nets, surrounding (encircling, or encompassing) nets, and trap nets. Drift nets—which include gill and trammel nets used at the surface and bottom-set nets used on the seabed—capture fish by entangling them. Gill and trammel nets are used principally to catch herring and salmon and are the most common drift nets. In commercial fishing, a long fleet of drift nets, often several miles in length, is suspended vertically with a line of corks or other floats at the top and a line of lead weights at the bottom. Adjustable floats maintain the net at the desired depth, and lighted marker buoys are placed at intervals. These nets are dropped from a ship at sunset because they can be seen by the fish if dropped during daylight. After the boat anchors, the net drifts all night. As a fish attempts to swim through a gill net, its head penetrates the mesh, and a section of twine slips under its gill cover, entangling it. The trammel net, on the other hand, is composed of two outer panels of large-mesh netting enclosing an inner panel of finer netting. It entangles the fish in pockets formed by the passing of the inner net through the mesh of the outer net.

Surrounding nets are fine, heavy nets that capture fish by encircling them. Seine nets, trawls, dredges, and long lines are all varieties of surrounding nets. Of these, the most widely used are the seine and the trawl. Beach, or drag, seines can be hauled onto a beach with their contents; others, called purse seines, are operated from boats in deep water far from the shore. A steel cable that runs through rings at the bottom of the purse seine is pulled up to close the net. Seine nets (also known as ring, or round, nets) are used to catch sardines, herring, pilchards, salmon, and tuna. The other principal form of surrounding net is the trawl, a bag-shaped net that is dragged by a specialized vessel (trawler) along the bottom of the sea or in midwater. Trawls are used to catch cod, haddock, plaice, and sole, which are trapped in the net when it is pulled to the surface.

Trap nets are stationary nets that are staked to the shore or in estuaries. They form a labyrinth-like chamber into which fish can easily enter, and from which they cannot easily escape. Salmon, trout, and eels are the principal catch.

Although nets are primarily used in commercial fishing, they also are used in land capture of animals (birds, butterflies, and much larger animals), and they have many uses in industry, sports, and horticulture.
